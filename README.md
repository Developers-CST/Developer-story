## Shift left testing
_Shift-left testing is an approach to software testing and system testing in which testing is performed earlier in the lifecycle (i.e. moved left on the project timeline). It is the first half of the maxim "test early and often"._

I was working on my super cool computer projects, I met this amazing tool called Snyk. It was like having a superhero sidekick for my coding adventures. Snyk helped me find and fix problems in my code, making sure my creations were strong and safe.

But my curiosity led me to explore other coding buddies. SonarQube was like a wise mentor, always checking if my coding words were just right. Then there was OWASP Dependency-Check, the guardian who made sure no sneaky bugs tried to creep into my work.

As I continued my coding journey, I discovered the "shift-left" secret. It was like putting on a superhero cape early on, catching problems right from the start. Snyk and my new buddies were there, helping me build a fortress of code that could withstand any challenges.
